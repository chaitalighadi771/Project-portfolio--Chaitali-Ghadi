## About Me

I Chaitali Ghadi, a graduate with a B.Sc. in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance,
My academic and project experience lies at the intersection of quantitative modeling, financial analytics, and machine learning.

Throughout my degree, I have worked on practical, data-driven projects involving interest rate derivatives, exotic option pricing, portfolio risk evaluation, and predictive modeling using Python, R, and Excel. I enjoy solving analytical problems with precision, creativity, and curiosity.

This repository showcases a curated selection of my academic and applied work across finance, risk management, and machine learning domains.

## Finance and Risk Management Projects

### 1. RBL Bank â€“ Risk Management Framework *(RMIM1 Project)*
-Conducted a detailed review of RBL Bankâ€™s annual reports and quarterly Basel III disclosures.
- Identified and classified core risk types: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB).
- Mapped each risk type to relevant Basel Pillars (I, II, III) to understand the capital adequacy and risk control structure.
- Analyzed the bankâ€™s Non-Performing Asset (NPA) ratios, credit cost, and provisioning trends to assess credit risk exposure.
- Reviewed market risk disclosures including interest rate risk, value-at-risk, and exposure limits across trading and banking books.
- Evaluated the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), asset-liability maturity mismatches, and funding structure to assess liquidity risk.
- Summarized key metrics such as CRAR, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, and risk-weighted assets to determine capital adequacy performance.
- Interpreted the bankâ€™s approach to operational risk management, including internal control structure and loss-event reporting.
- Studied risk governance and Board-level risk oversight processes documented in public disclosures.
- Developed a comprehensive risk map and linked financial indicators to each risk category.

- Tools: PowerPoint, RBI & Basel disclosures

- Valuation of a fixed-income security with call and put embedded options.
- Includes plain bond pricing, option valuation, and final pricing using Excel.
- Covers concepts like YTM, NPV, and volatility-based simulation.
- **[Access available on request]**

###  8. Basel III & IV Implementation Analysis â€“ Comparative Banking Project
-  Analyzed regulatory compliance frameworks of SBI (India) and DBS Bank (Singapore) under Basel III and IV standards to assess capital adequacy, liquidity management, and risk governance practices.
-  Conducted a deep-dive analysis into Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), Leverage Ratio, and ICAAP processes using real bank disclosures and regulatory filings.
-  Evaluated cross-jurisdictional regulatory approaches (RBI vs MAS) and their alignment with Basel Committee standards, emphasizing implications on financial resilience and systemic risk control.
-  Assessed the impact of Basel IV reforms on Risk-Weighted Asset (RWA) calculations, output floors, internal model constraints, and capital buffersâ€”highlighting key challenges in credit, market, and operational risk transitions.
-  Delivered strategic recommendations for adapting to Basel IV, covering capital optimization, stress testing, compliance automation, and treasury adjustments.
-  Presented findings through a data-driven and regulatory-anchored presentation, demonstrating expertise in international liquidity risk frameworks and financial stability planning.
