## About Me

I Chaitali Ghadi, a recent graduate with a B.Sc. in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance,
My academic and project experience lies at the intersection of quantitative modeling, financial analytics, and machine learning.

Throughout my degree, I have worked on practical, data-driven projects involving interest rate derivatives, exotic option pricing, portfolio risk evaluation, and predictive modeling using Python, R, and Excel. I enjoy solving analytical problems with precision, creativity, and curiosity.

This repository showcases a curated selection of my academic and applied work across finance, risk management, and machine learning domains.
